The dictionary values should be `set` objects; the value associated with key $a_i$ should be the set $\\{b_k:a_k=a_i\\}$. For example, the input list `[(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]` should return the dictionary `{1: {2}, 3: {4}, 5: {6}}`. Input pairs could contain strings or numbers. Furthermore, you should not assume that the keys $a_i$ are distinct; your code should handle repeated keys by adding extra values to the associated set. For example, the input list `[(1,'a'),(1,3)]` should return the dictionary `{1: {'a', 3}}`. A concise description of the function's action is described in the function's docstring below, and several tests are provided."
